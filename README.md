# 🖼️ Meme Generator – A React App for Custom Memes

**Meme Generator** is a fun and interactive React app that allows users to create their own memes by entering top and bottom text over randomly selected meme images. It fetches templates from an API and updates the content in real time.

Built as part of the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend), this project helped me strengthen my understanding of controlled components, event handling, and dynamic rendering in React.
